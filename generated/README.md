# Generated Content Directory

This directory stores all content generated by the `/wp-content` skill.

## What's Stored Here

When you use `/wp-content` to create blog posts, landing pages, or documentation, the generated markdown files are saved here with descriptive filenames.

**Filename format:**
```
YYYY-MM-DD_content-type_slug.md
```

**Examples:**
- `2024-01-21_landing-page_taskflow-features.md`
- `2024-01-21_blog-post_wordpress-security-tips.md`
- `2024-01-21_documentation_api-webhooks.md`

## Why This Directory Exists

Generated content is preserved so you can:

1. **Re-publish updated versions** - Edit and republish
2. **Keep an archive** - Track what was published when
3. **Use as templates** - Copy successful content structures
4. **Maintain source files** - WordPress has the HTML, this has the markdown

## Usage

### View Generated Content

```bash
# List all generated files
ls -lh generated/

# Read a specific file
cat generated/2024-01-21_landing-page_taskflow.md
```

### Re-publish Content

```bash
# Republish after editing
python3.11 publish.py generated/2024-01-21_landing-page_taskflow.md --status publish
```

### Use as Template

```bash
# Copy and modify for new content
cp generated/2024-01-21_landing-page_taskflow.md generated/2024-01-22_landing-page_newproduct.md
# Edit the new file
# Publish when ready
```

### Clean Up Old Files

```bash
# Remove files you no longer need
rm generated/2024-01-21_old-content.md
```

## Git Ignore

The markdown files in this directory are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`). This is intentional - generated content is specific to your WordPress site and shouldn't be committed to the repository.

This README is tracked by git to explain the directory's purpose.
